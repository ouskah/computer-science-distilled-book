# Chapter 1 - Self-notes

## 1.1 Ideas
  * Math modeling is important to express abstract ideas.

## 1.2 Logic
  * Common math operators: variables and operators `+ / * -`
  * Logic math: `true` or `false`
  * Dependency between variables is express with the conditional operator: `->`. `A -> B`, implies that B depends on A to be true.
    - Example: If it rains, then I'll take my umbrella.
  * Negation operator: `!`
  * Contrapositive equivalent. Every conditional expression has its contrapositive value. Given `A -> B` its contrapositive is `!B -> !A`.
    - Example: I won't take my umbrella if it does not rain.
  * Bi-conditional. `A <-> B` expresses that A depends on B and vice versa.
    - Example: If it rains, I'll take my umbrella. I'll take my umbrella, if it rains.
  * NOTE: `A -> B` is not equal to `B -> A`.
  * AND, OR and Exclusive OR (XOR)
  * Boolean comes from George Bool.
  * A truth table of 30 variables will require more than a billion of rows.
